        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> These easy-to-make snickerdoodle bars have all the charm of their namesake cookies,
            but without all the hassle of rolling out the dough.
            You want to keep a close eye on these bars while they bake, and take care to not <em>overbake them.</em> </p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup firmly packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon, divided</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                    Line an 8x8-inch square pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Cream together butter, 1/2 cup white sugar,
                    and brown sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.
                    Mix in egg and vanilla until thoroughly combined. Add in flour, cream of tartar,
                    baking soda, salt, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and nutmeg, and mix until a dough just begins to form.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Place dough into prepared pan. Using lightly floured hands,
                    press dough firmly and evenly into the bottom of the pan.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In a small bowl, mix together 1 tablespoon white sugar
                    and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Sprinkle evenly over the dough.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Place pan into the preheated oven, and bake just
                    until the dough in the center of the pan feels barely set, 20 to 23 minutes. Do not over bake.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Allow cookies to cool in pan for 10 minutes before removing to a
                    wire rack to cool completely. Cut into 16 bars.</p>
            </li>
