        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> So creamy and good - the strawberry flavor really comes through in the
            cheesecake and the chocolate crust and ganache work great with the strawberries.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). 
                    Wrap outside of a lightly greased (with cooking spray) 9-inch springform pan
                    with a double layer of heavy-duty aluminum foil.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Stir together cookies, melted butter, and granulated sugar in a bowl.
                    Press onto bottom and 1-inch up sides of prepared pan.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven until crust is set, 7 to 8 minutes.
                    Transfer to a wire rack; cool completely, 30 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Preheat the oven again to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Process chopped strawberries in a food processor until
                    completely smooth, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. Set strawberry puree aside.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Beat cream cheese with a stand mixer fitted with a
                    paddle attachment on medium speed until creamy, 2 to 3 minutes.
                    Gradually add sugar and flour, beating until smooth, about 1 minute.
                    Add whole eggs, 1 at a time, beating on low speed just until blended after each addition (do not overbeat).
                    Add egg yolks, 1 at a time, beating until just blended after each addition.</p>
